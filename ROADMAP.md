# Vision Guide - AI Assistant for the Visually Impaired
## Complete Project Roadmap & Documentation

### üéØ Project Overview
Vision Guide is a comprehensive web application designed specifically for blind and visually impaired users. The application provides hands-free, voice-controlled navigation, real-time YOLO object detection, emergency assistance, and customizable accessibility features. Every interaction in the app is designed to work through enhanced voice commands with improved recognition accuracy.

### üéôÔ∏è Core Philosophy: Voice-First Design
**CRITICAL**: This application is designed for users who cannot see. Therefore:
- ALL functionality MUST be accessible via voice commands
- ALL voice commands MUST start with the wake word "Hey Vision"
- Enhanced speech recognition with pattern matching for 95%+ accuracy
- Visual elements are secondary and serve only as backup for sighted assistants
- Voice feedback MUST be immediate and descriptive
- No action should require visual interaction
