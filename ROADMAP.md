# Vision Guide - AI Assistant for the Visually Impaired
## Complete Project Roadmap & Documentation

### üéØ Project Overview
Vision Guide is a comprehensive web application designed specifically for blind and visually impaired users. The application provides hands-free, voice-controlled navigation, object detection, emergency assistance, and customizable accessibility features. Every interaction in the app is designed to work through voice commands, making it fully accessible without requiring sight.

### üéôÔ∏è Core Philosophy: Voice-First Design
**CRITICAL**: This application is designed for users who cannot see. Therefore:
- ALL functionality MUST be accessible via voice commands
- ALL voice commands MUST start with the wake word "Hey Vision"
- Visual elements are secondary and serve only as backup for sighted assistants
- Voice feedback MUST be immediate and descriptive
- No action should require visual interaction

## üìû Support and Resources

For developers working on this project:
- This roadmap should be consulted before making changes
- All new features must maintain voice-first accessibility
- Regular testing with actual visually impaired users recommended
- Prioritize safety and emergency access above all other features

**Remember**: This app serves as a critical accessibility tool. Every decision should be made with the safety and independence of visually impaired users as the top priority.
